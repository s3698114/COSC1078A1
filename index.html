								<p>I always interested in it since a litte. I got my first computer in 2004 and it was still using Windows 98. No internet at that time, so I spent a lot of time in the computer by inspecting the OS, try to troubleshoot problems etc. In 2009, the first time I use internet, I try online games, and then try to play with virtual machines and install the old OS in the VM.</p>
								<p>I choose RMIT because RMIT is one of the top universities in Melbourne to study Information Technology. RMIT also provides good facilities to support the IT program, and also located in the CBD, so it is easy to get there.</p>
								<p>In this course, I'm expecting to learn skills for my future job, and also get soft skills like communications, teamwork etc. that would be useful for life.</p>

								<img src="images/big5.png" alt="Big 5 Personality" height="550" width="550">
								<p>The Big 5 Personality test shows the 5 major dimensions of personality (OCEAN): </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete. They tend to avoid the unknown and follow traditional ways. </li>
									<li>Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked. </li>
									<li>Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.</li>
									<li>Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.</li>
									<li>Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.</li>
